Orlando's refactoring of route-me implemenation
1, enhancement of supported Tile Source:
***planned to add njosmTileSource for localization of high resolution-pixel traffic map***
-> osm mapnik enhancement
-> tile source implementation

2, loading/error/missing tile enhancement
-> Tile Images/RMTileProxy.m 
override the pngs; and also compress and load high resolution-pixel picture

3, enhancement of route-me RMMapView to customized Orlando's MapView
-> showUserLocation implementation
+ wrapped marker to UserLocation CALayer with animiation
   i) UserLocation in naive proxy - ShowUserLocationProxy
      => RMMapView - add ShowUserLocationProxy* proxy instance
      => RMMapView+ShowUserLocation - add informal protocol to enable
      => ShowUserLocationProxy - add location monitor & marker
	TODO : 
	1) better wrapper of marker for userlocation;
	2) animiation for userlocation;
	   * user with customized layer - RMUserAnimationLayer and remove it after animiation has been done.
	   * move to other user location - move to [done, without testing]
	   * central blue dot with gradient new layer [not done, in programming iOS 4, Page 326, 332]      
   ii) User heading enhancement layer - plan [later after route layers]

+ wrapped track with animiation and updating
